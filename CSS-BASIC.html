        <h1>CSS Basics</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the world of web design and CSS! In this short journey, we'll explore the fundamentals of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and how they can transform a plain HTML document into a visually appealing web page.</p>
        <h2>Introduction to CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a powerful tool that allows you to control the presentation and layout of your web pages. It's what makes a website look beautiful and organized.</p>
        <h2>Including CSS</h2>
        <p>To apply CSS to an HTML document, you can either use an internal 'style' block within the HTML file or an external CSS file linked using the 'link' tag in the HTML's 'head' section.</p>
        <h2>Selectors</h2>
        <p>Selectors are the heart of CSS. They define which HTML elements you want to style. For instance, using h1 as a selector targets all the 'h1' headings in your document.</p>
        <h2>Properties and Values</h2>
        <p>CSS properties specify what you want to style, and values determine how you want to style it. For example, you can set the color property to blue to change the text color.</p>
        <h2>Classes and IDs</h2>
        <p>Classes and IDs allow you to apply styles to specific elements. Classes are indicated by a period (.), while IDs are denoted by a hash (#). This way, you can make elements stand out or share styles with others.</p>
        <h2>Inheritance</h2>
        <p>CSS properties are inherited from parent elements to their children. This helps maintain consistency and reduces redundancy in your code.</p>
        <h2>The Box Model</h2>
        <p>The best way to learn CSS is through hands-on practice. Experiment with different styles, create layouts, and don't be afraid to break things, that's how you learn and improve your skills.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>CSS is your gateway to crafting visually stunning web pages. With these basic principles in mind, you're ready to start your journey into the world of web design and CSS. Happy styling!</p>
